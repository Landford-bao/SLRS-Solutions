    "## 2-1 Insertion sort on small arrays in merge sort\n",
    "> Although merge sort runs in $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$ worst-case time and insertion sort runs in $\\Theta(n^2)$ worst-case time, the constant factors in insertion sort can make it faster in practice for small problem sizes on many machines. Thus, it makes sense to **_coarsen_** the leaves of the recursion by using insertion sort within merge sort when subproblems become sufficiently small. Consider a modification to merge sort in which $n / k$ sublists of length $k$ are sorted using insertion sort and then merged using the standard merging mechanism, where $k$ is a value to be determined.\n",

    "**a.** The worst-case time to sort a list of length $k$ by insertion sort is $\\Theta(k^2)$. Therefore, sorting $n / k$ sublists, each of length $k$ takes $\\Theta(k^2 \\cdot n / k) = \\Theta(nk)$ worst-case time.\n",

    "**b.** We have $n / k$ sorted sublists each of length $k$. To merge these $n / k$ sorted sublists to a single sorted list of length $n$, we have to take $2$ sublists at a time and continue to merge them. This will result in $\\lg(n / k)$ steps and we compare $n$ elements in each step. Therefore, the worst-case time to merge the sublists is $\\Theta(n\\lg(n / k))$.\n",
